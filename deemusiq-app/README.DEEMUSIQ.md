# DeeMusiq — App (rebranded Spotube)

> *It's a drop day.* This folder is the **DeeMusiq Android/desktop app**, a rebrand of the
> open-source [Spotube](https://github.com/KRTirtho/spotube) engine (BSD-4-Clause — see
> [`NOTICE.md`](./NOTICE.md)).

**Heads-up (honest status):** the source has been fully rebranded to DeeMusiq. The Hetu
scripting engine and external plugin system have been removed — DeeMusiq now uses only its
native Dart backend plugin. Flutter is installed on this machine and the app builds locally
for Linux. Other platforms build via GitHub Actions.

---

## 🟢 Build the DeeMusiq APK (no coding, ~15–25 min in the cloud)

1. Create a **free** GitHub account at <https://github.com> if you don't have one.
2. Make a new repository, e.g. `deemusiq-app` (Public or Private both work).
3. Upload **everything in this `deemusiq-app` folder** to it (drag-and-drop on the repo
   page → *uploading an existing file*), and **Commit**.
4. Open the **Actions** tab → enable workflows if prompted →
   pick **“Build DeeMusiq (Android APK)”** → **Run workflow**.
5. Wait for the green tick. Open the finished run → **Artifacts** → download
   **`DeeMusiq-apk`**. Inside is **`DeeMusiq.apk`**.
6. Send that APK to an Android phone, tap it, allow “install from unknown sources”. Done. 🎉

### Make it a public download (auto-attached to a Release)
Instead of step 4, create a **tag** named `v1.0.0` (repo → Releases → Draft a new release →
choose a tag `v1.0.0` → Publish). The workflow runs automatically and attaches
`DeeMusiq.apk` to that Release. The public download link is then:

```
https://github.com/deemusiq/deemusiq/releases/latest/download/DeeMusiq.apk
```

The website (`deemusiq-site/js/main.js` → `DOWNLOADS.android`) already points at
this link — it goes live the moment the first `v*` release is published.

---

## 🔐 Signing (important before you go public)

The first build auto-creates a **temporary** signing key so the APK installs immediately
for testing. For a real public release, set a **permanent** keystore so that future updates
install over older versions. One-time setup:

1. On any computer with Java, create a keystore:
   ```bash
   keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore deemusiq.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 \
     -validity 10000 -alias deemusiq \
     -dname "CN=DeeMusiq, O=The Dembe Group, C=ZA"
   ```
   (it asks you to set a password — remember it)
2. Turn it into text: `base64 -w0 deemusiq.jks > keystore.txt`
3. In your GitHub repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New secret**, add:
   | Secret name | Value |
   |-------------|-------|
   | `KEYSTORE_BASE64` | the contents of `keystore.txt` |
   | `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | the password you chose |
   | `KEY_ALIAS` | `deemusiq` |
   | `KEY_PASSWORD` | the password you chose |
4. Re-run the workflow — it now signs with your permanent key.

⚠️ Keep `deemusiq.jks` and its passwords safe. If you lose them you can't ship updates
to already-installed users.

## 🚀 Go-Live checklist (everything the owner must configure)

Nothing below is hardcoded — the app and backend run in safe offline/sandbox
modes until you set these. Cross-references: [`DEEMUSIQ_WALLET.md`](./DEEMUSIQ_WALLET.md)
and the backend's own README (private repo
[`s-b-repo/deemusiq-backend`](https://github.com/s-b-repo/deemusiq-backend),
which has a "Secrets you MUST change" section).

| What | Where | How |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Backend deployment** | Render / Docker (see backend README) | Deploy first; everything below hangs off it. |
| **Backend URL in the app** | GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → **Variables** → `DEEMUSIQ_BACKEND_URL` | e.g. `https://api.deemusiq.co.za`. Empty = app stays offline-only (still works). |
| **Secure channel key** | Repo **secret** `DEEMUSIQ_CHANNEL_KEY` + backend `.env` `SECURE_CHANNEL_KEY` | Must be identical on both sides: `openssl rand -base64 32`. |
| **Card payments** | Backend `.env`: `PAYFAST_*` / `STRIPE_*` + provider dashboards' webhook URLs → `https://<backend>/webhooks/payfast` / `/webhooks/stripe` | Until set, checkout returns "unavailable" safely. Set `PAYFAST_SANDBOX=false` only when going live. |
| **Crypto payments** | Backend `.env`: `NOWPAYMENTS_*`, `CRYPTO_ADDR_*` | Deposit addresses live **only** on the backend — never in the app. |
| **Verification emails** | Backend `.env`: `SMTP_HOST/PORT/USER/PASS/FROM` | Logs-only until set (registration still works). |
| **Spotify account linking** | Backend `.env`: `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID/SECRET`, redirect URI `https://<backend>/link/spotify/callback` (register it in the Spotify dev dashboard) | Other providers show "coming soon" until adapters exist. |
| **Permanent signing keystore** | Repo secrets `KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`, `KEY_PASSWORD` | See "Signing" above — **do this before the first public release.** |
| **Anti-tamper cert pin** | Repo secret `DEEMUSIQ_CERT_SHA256` (+ optional backend `EXPECTED_CERT_SHA256`) | See "Anti-tamper" below. Arms the brick-on-repackage check. Set it right after the permanent keystore. |
| **Backend TLS cert pin** | Repo secret `DEEMUSIQ_SERVER_CERT_SHA256` | SHA-256 of the backend's TLS leaf cert (comma-separated pins for rotation). When set, wallet/payment TLS is pinned and an active startup/6h probe locks money features if the reachable backend presents a different cert. |
| **Integrity hash signing key** | Build define `DEEMUSIQ_INTEGRITY_ED25519_PUBLIC_KEY` | Base64 Ed25519 public key. When set, the published APK-hash payload must carry a valid `X-Body-Signature` (hex Ed25519 over the raw body) — unsigned/invalid payloads lock the wallet as tamper evidence. |
| **Site update metadata** | Build define `DEEMUSIQ_UPDATE_METADATA_URL` | Point to the Cloudflare/site `version.json`; redirects are rejected. Optional raw-body digest/signature headers are supported. |
| **Update signing key** | Build define `DEEMUSIQ_UPDATE_ED25519_PUBLIC_KEY` | Base64 Ed25519 public key. When set, the endpoint must provide a valid signature over the exact response bytes — either `X-DeeMusiq-Signature` (base64) or the worker's `X-Body-Signature` (hex) header. |
| **Desktop yt-dlp pin** | Build defines `DEEMUSIQ_YTDLP_VERSION` and `DEEMUSIQ_YTDLP_SHA256` | Both are mandatory. A selected executable is unavailable unless its file digest and reported version both match. Supply the digest for the exact platform asset. |
| **Site download link** | `deemusiq-site/js/main.js` | Android already wired; goes live with the first `v*` release. |
| **Site social links** | `deemusiq-site/index.html` footer | Currently `#` placeholders — fill in when the accounts exist. |
| **Release process** | — | Bump `pubspec.yaml` `x.y.z+N` → push tag `vx.y.z` → CI checks, builds, signs, attaches `DeeMusiq.apk` to the Release. |

## 🛡️ Anti-tamper (stops fake / repackaged copies)

The app verifies it hasn't been modified, on two independent levels:

1. **Signing certificate (strong, offline).** A modified APK must be re-signed
   with a different key, which changes its certificate hash. When you pin the
   expected hash, the app **refuses to start** if it's signed with anything else.
   This is the real protection and needs no internet.
2. **Published APK hash (supplementary, online).** CI publishes
   `DeeMusiq.apk.sha256` next to the APK on each release. At boot and again every
   1–10 minutes the app hashes its own installed APK and compares. A confirmed
   mismatch **locks the wallet/payments** (music keeps playing) and reports the
   event to the backend (`/integrity/report`). If GitHub is unreachable, nothing
   is locked — outages never punish real users.

Crypto payments stay safe because the **deposit address is never in the app** —
the backend owns it (`CRYPTO_ADDR_*`), sends it over the encrypted channel, and
confirms funds on-chain. A fake app can't redirect a real top-up.

**To arm the certificate brick (after you set the permanent keystore):**
```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore deemusiq.jks -alias deemusiq   # find the SHA256 line
```
Take that `SHA256:` fingerprint, remove the colons, lowercase it, and add it as
the repo **secret** `DEEMUSIQ_CERT_SHA256`. (Optionally set the same value as the
backend's `EXPECTED_CERT_SHA256` so tamper reports are annotated.) Until you set
it, the certificate check is informational only — the temporary CI keystore
changes every build and can't be pinned.

> Honest limit: client-side checks defeat casual repackaging and give you
> tamper telemetry, but they're not unbreakable DRM (that would need Google's
> Play Integrity API, which requires Play Store distribution). The address being
> server-owned is what actually protects users' money.

## 📌 Release rule (version numbering)

The `version:` in [`pubspec.yaml`](./pubspec.yaml) is `x.y.z+buildNumber`. When you cut a
release:

- the **`x.y.z` part must equal the next git tag `vx.y.z`** (e.g. `version: 1.0.0+46`
  → tag `v1.0.0`). The in-app update checker compares the running version against the
  latest release tag, so a mismatch makes update prompts wrong.
- the **build number (`+N`) always increments**, on every release *and* every nightly,
  even if `x.y.z` didn't change — Android refuses to install an APK whose build number
  isn't higher than the installed one, and the nightly update checker compares build
  numbers against the Actions run number.
- bump **`VERSIONS` in `deemusiq-site/cloudflare/wrangler.toml`** to the same `x.y.z` —
  that map backs `/downloads/version.json`, so a stale pin means the update check never
  reports the new release.

## Accepted internal naming (deliberately NOT renamed)

These still say "spotube" on purpose — they are invisible to users, and renaming them
breaks builds or ecosystem compatibility for zero benefit:

| What | Why it stays |
|------|--------------|
| **l10n keys** (e.g. `about_spotube`, `u_love_spotube`) | The *values* already say DeeMusiq; renaming the keys ripples through 30+ `.arb` files plus generated localization code. |
| **Kotlin package** `oss.krtirtho.spotube` | Only a source-folder namespace; the user-visible `applicationId` is already `za.co.deemusiq.app`. Moving Kotlin packages risks breaking the Android build. |
| **Plugin-ecosystem identifiers** (`spotube-metadata-plugin` topics, `hetu_spotube_plugin`, `.smplug` plugin assets) | DeeMusiq consumes the existing Spotube plugin ecosystem; renaming the identifiers would find zero plugins. |
| **`_spotube._tcp` bonsoir service type** | mDNS discovery for the remote-control/connect feature; both ends must advertise the same service type to find each other. |
| **Internal Dart identifiers** (`package:hetu_spotube_plugin/...` imports, `spotube_plugin.*` storage keys) and the **flatpak id** `com.github.KRTirtho.Spotube` | Pure code-level names coming from upstream dependency packages (the app's own package is already `deemusiq`), plus the Linux flatpak icon id — no user ever sees them. |

## What was rebranded
See [`NOTICE.md`](./NOTICE.md) for the full list. In short: every place a user sees
"Spotube" now says **DeeMusiq**, the icon/splash/accent use your orange hexagon, and the
Android app id is `za.co.deemusiq.app`. Internal code names were intentionally left alone
so the app keeps building.

The Hetu scripting engine and external `.smplug` plugin system have been **removed**.
DeeMusiq now exclusively uses its own native Dart metadata plugin (`kDeeMusiqNativePluginConfig`)
that talks to the DeeMusiq backend `/metadata` API. No Spotify, no Hetu, no external plugins.

## Building other platforms (Windows / Linux / macOS)
The display names for those are already rebranded too. All four platforms build via
GitHub Actions workflows:
- `deemusiq-android.yml` — APK build
- `deemusiq-linux.yml` — `.deb` + `.AppImage` + `.tar.gz`
- `deemusiq-windows.yml` — `.exe` NSIS installer + portable `.zip`
- `deemusiq-macos.yml` — `.dmg` + `.zip`

Linux can also be built locally: `flutter build linux --release`. The binary is at
`build/linux/x64/release/bundle/deemusiq`.

To ship a portable AppImage that keeps working on machines without a
GTK/mpv/ffmpeg stack, use the packaging script — it assembles the AppDir with
the bundle layout Flutter expects (`usr/bin/data` + `usr/bin/lib/libapp.so`),
then verifies the packed image and smoke-runs it, so a regression fails the
build instead of shipping:

```bash
bash scripts/build-linux-appimage.sh            # build + pack + verify + smoke
bash scripts/build-linux-appimage.sh --skip-build   # re-pack an existing bundle
bash scripts/build-linux-appimage.sh --verify-only dist/DeeMusiq-linux-x86_64.AppImage
```

The CI `deemusiq-linux.yml` job runs the same script with `--skip-build`, so
local and release artifacts are packaged identically.

yt-dlp is self-managed: on first use the app downloads the newest official
yt-dlp release asset into its support folder (`<support>/bin/yt-dlp`),
SHA-256 records it and refreshes it when older than 7 days, so no
system-installed yt-dlp is ever required.

## Honest caveats
- **This app streams metadata/audio using YouTube as the audio source.** It does not host
  your own artists' uploads directly — that's the separate DeeMusiq backend platform.
  The native plugin proxies catalog data from the backend `/metadata` API.
- YouTube engine failover is automatic: youtube_explode_dart → yt-dlp → NewPipe with
  5 retries per engine and exponential backoff. Connection checker pings 8.8.8.8 + 1.1.1.1
  before attempting playback.
- **Backend-unreachable fallback:** a catalog track whose signed stream URL can no
  longer be re-minted (DeeMusiq API network-unreachable, or the origin/edge is
  failing with a 5xx) is re-found
  through YouTube search (title + artist, closest duration wins) and streamed
  straight from YouTube, announced with an info toast. The cached catalog source is
  left intact, so the backend path resumes by itself once the API answers again —
  see `_youtubeFallbackStreams` in `lib/services/metadata/deemusiq_native_plugin.dart`.

## Known TODO: drift DB migration tests

Upstream's `test/drift/` migration suite was removed: its drift-generated
`schema_v*.dart` step files were stale against the current database schema and
no longer compiled (broken at rest, first caught when CI gained a test gate).
The app's real migrations still run (drift step-by-step migrations in
`lib/models/database/`). To restore the suite, regenerate the steps with
`dart run drift_dev make-migrations` on a machine with the Flutter toolchain,
then re-add the tests.
